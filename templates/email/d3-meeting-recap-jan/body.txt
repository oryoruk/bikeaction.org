Hi {{ first_name }},

**Greetings District 3\! Here is our meeting recap from Monday, January 12\. Lots of action items here for anyone who’d like to get involved\!** 

**West Market Street Safety Campaign:🦺**

* The stretch of Market St. around Penn and Drexel, westward to 46th St., is very wide, encouraging dangerous driving. Two pedestrians were killed on Penn/Drexel campuses by drivers last November.  
* Braxton is leading a campaign and petition to make Market Street safer for all users. Two ways you can help:  
* Printing flyers  
* Weekday availability to canvass for support in the area (esp. Drexel campus)  
* Message @brxtn1 if you can contribute.

**Death of Teddy Einstein \+ Road Safety in Upper Darby: 💕**

* Ruth Fahey, the widow of Teddy Einstein, shared her work to make safety improvements on the Upper Darby road where Teddy was killed. Ruth has attended our meetings in the past and is now focusing her efforts on advocacy in Upper Darby.   There will be an angel bike dedication in March, and a celebration of Teddy’s life in June at Clark Park.  
* She expressed the need for large numbers of supporters to turn out for certain events (TBA). Stay tuned for this\!  
*  If you know people in Upper Darby/DelCo who would be interested in supporting Ruth’s efforts, please reach out to Jacob (D1), a friend of Ruth and Teddy’s. @jrussell\_59268.

**Fairmount Park Traffic Calming: 🚦**

* PBA member Harry Fenton was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Belmont Ave last year.  
* Our petition (1800+ signatures) for a safer Fairmount Park was presented to CM Curtis Jones on January 6\. This highlighted the importance of traffic safety in the park to a Councilmember who had not considered this issue before.   
* Want to get involved and push this forward? Join the \#fairmount-park channel or reach out to Jason D. @floodfish.

**Lancaster Avenue: 🛑**

* June Rodriguez was killed by a hit-and-run driver on the stretch of Lancaster between 52nd and 57th street in December. In this area, the wide road and lack of traffic signals leads to extremely fast, dangerous driving.  
* This area needs a champion(s) to lead a campaign to make it safer. Could that be you?  
* The section of Lancaster Ave where June was killed is in District 4\. This would be a good opportunity for collaboration with District 4\.

**58th and Baltimore:🚎**

* Jeff Ishibashi was killed here in the spring, lending urgency to the safety improvements that local residents have been demanding for years.   
* Some traffic calming and red light cameras are coming soon, but the intersection is still likely to be a bad one for pedestrian/cyclist/SEPTA user safety.

**48th and Woodland Safety Improvements (connection to Grays Ferry Bridge)🌉**

* The City of Philadelphia is gathering feedback around traffic safety in the neighborhood surrounding the 48th & Woodland playground. There is an online survey open through the end of January. It’s especially important to give feedback if you live or frequently travel through this area:  
* https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/59fa1d9e5c60464984823f1e9345a48a  
* Volunteers needed to bring in support & more survey responses\! Want to contribute? Join \#48th-woodland

**52nd Street Corridor Improvement Project: 🏬**

* On January Wednesday January 28, 6-8pm at Global Leadership Academy (school at 52nd and Pine) there will be a public meeting about the 52nd Street Commercial Corridor Improvement Project.    
* PBA members are encouraged to attend. So far we have little information about what this project will include, but this could be an important opportunity to push for traffic safety improvements.

**Bike Lane Cleanups: 🧹**

* As always, we need volunteers to plan bike lane cleanups\! There is an easy toolkit (thanks Braxton) to get you started with planning one, and no shortage of volunteers to coach you if it’s your first time.    
* There is no such thing as too many bike lane cleanups, and they’re one of the best ways PBA gets visibility in the community. Be a leader and plan one yourself\! If interested, contact Braxton, Elise, or Andre\! @brxtn1, @elisedud, @doop\_city

**Help needed: PBA Tech Team\! 🧑‍💻**

* If you or someone you know can help out building and maintaining PBA’s site and tech infrastructure, let us know\! You don’t have to be an ultra-skilled coder to help\! Contact Jason D if interested. @floodfish.

**Upcoming events: 🗓️**

* Jan 28, 6-8pm \- 52nd Street Arch to Pine Commercial Corridor Improvement Project (Global Leadership Academy, 5200 Pine)
