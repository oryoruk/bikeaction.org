Thanks for your interest in attending the Belmont Speedway Family Picnic. Unfortunately, due to the large storm passing through the region this weekend, we have decided to **postpone The Belmont Speedway Family Picnic.** It will now happen in one week’s time, on Sunday, Oct. 19th from 12-2 p.m. We hope you all can make it then.
