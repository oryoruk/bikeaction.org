<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQXX2l3kY5R/?igsh=OHFjajRjOGoyN2Rk">Center City Quality of Life Town Hall</a><br> 
THIS Wednesday, November 5th, 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM<br>
Parkway Central Library, 1901 Vine Street

CM Young has said he is holding off on several important roadway safety bills because he wants to *hear from the community*. **This is our chance to be heard\!**

Please attend and voice support for: 

* **Loading Zones for ALL of Center City**, which enables bike lane protection (CM Young has [carved out his district](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/philadelphia-city-council-restaurant-scalper-crackdown-bike-lanes-schools-20251016.html) from the most recent Center City Loading Zones enabling bill)

* **The City Hall Bike Lane bill**, which would enable a separated bike lane around City Hall to be made street legal and permanent. (CM Young has [held up this bill in committee](https://www.inquirer.com/news/bike-lane-philadelphia-city-hall-jeffery-young-20251005.html) \-- despite over 1,400 petition signers in support and confirmation from OTIS and PennDOT of its safety)

* **16th Street Bike Lane bill**, which would enable a tiny, but important, bike lane between Market and JFK. (Despite community support and a presentation by OTIS this Fall, CM Young has **NOT** introduced this bill)
